This is regarding assignment 4 for CMPUT 299, at University Of Alberta submitted by Ritvik Khanna

All the codes in problems 1-3 were taken from http://inventwithpython.com/hacking/ in the download source and other files for this book. As stated in the assignment only necessary changes were made to the program to solve the problems. Except the minor changes made in the program I did not write the rest of the code and is a work of AI Sweigart and was downloaded from the above said website. Some of the files in the Assignment 4 problem folder, were given to me by the CMPUT 299 TA and the CMPUT 299 Professor.

My solution is highly based on the source code as mentioned by professor Greg Kondrak. I have made all the programs user friendly which asks the user to what to do.
